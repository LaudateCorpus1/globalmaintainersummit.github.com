In between, we’ll chat with each other, and know we’re not alone in the issues we face.</p><p>Global Maintainer Summit is your chance to build collaborative relationships with other maintainers, cultivate new skills to reinforce your resiliency and avoid burnout, and explore solutions to the myriad of shared challenges maintainers face.</p>",
